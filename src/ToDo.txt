TODO List For ENGINE: FOR (G4F and G4P)
	[ ] Spatial Partitioning using Quadtree data structure 		PRIORITY [2]
	[x] Point of collision for geometric primitives 					PRIORITY [1]
	[ ] Property animation system 									PRIORITY [4]
	[ ] Level of detail infrastructure 									PRIORITY [3]	
			: Zooming in and out should dynamically scale the amount of detail being rendered on screen
	[ ] Add more methods to the Graphics object to allow for textured shapes to be drawn.
	[x] Create basic camera system to handle large worlds

DEVLOG: (Started 11/7/2014)
	: Completed basic camera system 
	: Working on implementing point of collision for shapes using polygon clipping.
		- Point of Collision for circles and cirlce to polygon have been implemented.
		  Remaining to finish polygon to polygon.
(11/13/2014)
	: Debugging point of collision between polygon and polygon
	: Fixed scollbar behaviour, so now you only need to be hovered over it initially on the
		click, but can scroll as long as your held down (no need to be hovered).
	: Added Graphics Capabilities - Draw textures and shapes
	: Finished Debugging the point of collision between polygon and polygon. Algorithm
		 looks to be efficient for now.
