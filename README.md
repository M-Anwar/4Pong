4Pong

Introduction
---------

**Welcome to the 4Pong project**. This project was started as an exercise in programming and simple networking. The game was created from scratch using the Java programming language and the Java2D API. For networking, the underlying framework used was Kryonet (https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet).

*Feel free to browse our code and play the game yourself.*
